The project selected was geared to journalists with an interest in the history of the Women's World Cup from its inauguration in 1991 to 2019.  The user is able to gathering information about goals, wins, and champions throughout the years. In addition, the 2019 rosters provide player information, including international experience.

Instructions for navigating this app:
  - Overview tab: Welcome page with an audio clip you can play of the "official" 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup theme    song
  - World Cup Stats tab: Has additional two tabs, Goals per Country and Wins per Country.  You can compare countries and how many goals they scored across each World Cup year and see who was in each World Cup, the champion, and how many total goals each country scored for a selected year
  - World Cup Map tab: Select a World Cup year and see where the participating countries are located around the globe.  The gradient fill is not only used to identify the countries, but to give a glimpse as to who scored the most goals.
  - 2019 Roster tab: Displays every participating teams roster for 2019.  You can select a specific team, search based on a specific term (country, club, position, player, etc), and sort the table by a category.
  - About tab: includes Github and Bookdown report links
